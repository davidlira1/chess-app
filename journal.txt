thinking of the pawn function.
what the inputs are.

i had these thoughts.
when a piece moves, it will call a functionn
that function will receive the origina and destination,
as well as the player.
it will then, depending on the piece, call the respective function.
such as the pawn function.
each of those functions will also receive origin and destination, 
and maybe player as well, at least the pawn for sure needs it.
these function will return boolean
so back in the bigger fn
if true, execute the following:
if the destination location already has as value, 
the captured piece variable will containthen will replace that destination location in the 2D board array with the piece
but, if there is something already there, that value gets assigned to the 
captured piece variable.
then it replaces the destination value with the piece value.
it then returns an object, with the modified grid, and the captured piece.
return {
	modifiedGrid:
	
}

i just thought about this, it will also need to check if it's a check, or a checkmate.
**********************************************************************************************



var capturedPiece;

var capturedPiece = board[dest[row]][dest[col]] //value of destination
